# Portfolio for Robert Field
A list of categorised projects which I've created both in my spare time for learning and as academia.

## Academic Projects ##

## Web Development
Yes, web development. Me and a friend went through a stage of our lives where we started a freelancing business for local businesses. It's not live anymore (web development was never **the plan**), but the archived page is still hosted.
