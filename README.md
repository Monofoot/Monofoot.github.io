**Multiword Paraphrasing using Back-translation**

This was my Master's dissertation which involved analysing several sentence scoring metrics against news titles which had been back-translated. I'm really happy with how it went, as it was my first real foray into ML.

## Web Development
Yes, web development. Me and a friend went through a stage of our lives where we started a freelancing company for local businesses. It's not live anymore (web development was never **the plan**), but the archived page is still hosted.
